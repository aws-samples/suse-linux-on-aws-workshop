This workshop has focused on PAYG instances that are spun up through the EC2 console. However, you can also use SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications subscriptions through the AWS Marketplace. If you already have one of these set up, they come with the ability to enable extensions such as High Availability and Live Patching. This section provides a lab that lets you practice enabling those extensions, specifically the live patching extension.
