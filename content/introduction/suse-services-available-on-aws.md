There are two primary offerings of SUSE Linux on AWS. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or SLES, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications (SLES4SAP).

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is a secure, adaptable and easy-to-manage Linux server platform that allows developers and administrators to deploy business-critical workloads.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications makes it easier for systems administrators to deploy, configure, and protect the full SAP system stack quickly, reliably, and confidently.

The below links share the various services that SUSE offers on the AWS Marketplace. These include consulting for the implementation of your solution, support services for already deployed solutions, and training/learning materials about SUSE products.
