SUSE Linux is an operating system that is secure, agile, and resilient. SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAP is the [premier offering for running SAP](https://www.suse.com/partners/alliance/sap/#:~:text=Over%2020%2Dyear%20strategic%20partnership,operational%20efficiency%2C%20and%20drive%20innovation.), and is trusted and used by SAP customers who use Linux. It has automation software to accelerate SAP deployments and increase ease of use license management, high availability for better security and less downtime, advanced monitoring, and live patching. All of which work together to ensure that SAP stays up and running smoothly.

SUSE's reputation as the top option for working with SAP is in part due to their OS release cycle which closely mirrors the [SAP release cycle](https://news.sap.com/2022/09/new-sap-s4hana-release-maintenance-strategy/), based on SUSE's 20-year relationship with SAP.
