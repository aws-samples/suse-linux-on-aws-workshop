[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP](https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/) forms a critical part of any SAP landscape deployed on AWS.  Effectively maintaining this requires skill and knowledge around multiple topic areas, one of which is architecting OS lifecycle management solutions on AWS. The goal of this workshop is to educate and improve capability and understanding of how to maintain and patch SUSE environments on AWS. 
::alert[SAP Landscape is defined as an architecture of SAP servers. In an SAP environment, this is typically a three-system landscape consisting of a Development Server, a Production Server, and a Quality Assurance server.]{header="SAP Landscape"}

By the end of the session delegates will:
- Learn about the SUSE OS lifecycle in AWS
- Gain familiarity with [SUSEâ€™s Public Cloud Update Infrastructure](./public_cloud_infra.md)
- Execute both a major OS upgrade and service pack upgrade on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) on AWS
- Set up patch management on a SLES instance with AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
