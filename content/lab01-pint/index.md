P.I.N.T. stands for Public cloud INformation Tracker. It is a tool developed by the SUSE Public Cloud team on GitHub in the SUSE-Enceladus project and is backed by an APIÂ on suse.com. The tool provides information about images and the SUSE operated update infrastructure in Amazon EC2, and there is both a command line client and a [web-based frontend](https://pint.suse.com/?resource=images) available.
