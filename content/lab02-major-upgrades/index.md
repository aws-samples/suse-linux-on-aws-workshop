### Introduction to OS Upgrades with the Distribution Migration System

The [SUSE Distribution Migration System (DMS)](https://documentation.suse.com/suse-distribution-migration-system/15/single-html/distribution-migration-system/) provides an upgrade path for an installed SUSE Linux Enterprise system from one major version to another, for example, from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4/5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15. Instead of needing to use the next major version installation media to perform the system upgrade, you can use DMS to upgrade across major distributions.
