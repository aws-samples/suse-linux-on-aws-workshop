This section contains labs that work primarily with BYOS instances rather than PAYG. While PAYG is the recommended route, if you already have a subscription from SUSE, you can use these labs to register your instance with the SUSE Customer Center, connect to the public cloud update infrastructure, and even set up a private repository of updates so that your instance can update without being in a public subnet.

#### Next Steps:
You can choose either one of tasks 1 a) or 1 b) to complete the RMT infrastructure set up. 

1 a) uses a CloudFormation template to provision the architecture.

1 b) still uses a CloudFormation template, but introduces the user to the AWS Service Catalog and how to create a product that can be provisioned/deprovisioned with the click of a button.
