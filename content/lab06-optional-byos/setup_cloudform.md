This lab is completely optional, and requires a preexisting subscription with SUSE to operate. If you want to use PAYG (and not BYOS) instances through AWS, do not have an existing subscription with SUSE, or do not need to keep your instances isolated from the public internet, you should not continue with this lab. 

However, if you wish to practice setting up a private repository for our SLES instance to connect to, we will first need to provision the necessary architecture. This will require a public instance in a public subnet, a private instance in a private subnet that resides in the same VPC as the public subnet, and a properly configured security group among other things. To accomplish this setup, we will be configuring and then launching a service catalog product.

### Prerequisites Checklist

### Activity 1: Create the RMT CloudFormation Stack

#### Step 1: Navigate to the CloudFormation Home Page

First navigate to [AWS CloudFormation](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/) in the [AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1). Once there, make sure that you are in the North Virginia region, as our template is setup to work in that region specifically. You can find what region you are by checking the top right corner of the console, and if needed you can select that region and pick us-east-1 from the drop-down menu. 

![Which region you should be in](../../static/setup/cloudform_location.jpg)

#### Step 2: Create the Stack

We will now create a stack in CloudFormation. In the right menu, click on **Create stack**.

On the first page, select the following options:

- Template is ready
- Upload a template file

Next, download the lab template file from this link :link[CloudFormation Template]{href="/static/rmt/RMT_Infra.yaml" action=download}, upload it as the template file for our stack, and click **Next**.
![Create stack settings](../../static/rmt/cloudform_step1.jpg)

On the next page fill in the following values:

- Stack name: RMT-Lab-Infrastructure
- Fill in the name of the keypair that you wish to use. If you do not already have a key pair, you will need to create one through the AWS console. 
    - Make sure that you just put the file name, and not the file extension. For example, it would be keypair, not keypair.pem
    - If you need to create and download your own keypair, you can follow this guide: [How to Create a key pair in the AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair)
- Leave the instance type as the default (t2.micro)
::alert[If the stack fails to create because the instance type is unavailable, you can select one of the other options such as t3.micro or t2.small and re-run the create.]

Then proceed to the next page by clicking **Next**.

![Specify stack settings](../../static/rmt/cloudform_step2.jpg)

On the next page you should leave all of the settings as their default values. It is worth noting that in the case of a stack failure CloudFormation will automatically roll back/deprovision any resources that it created. Hit **Next** and proceed to the final page where you can review the settings you chose in the past three steps. After checking to ensure that everything looks correct, hit **Submit** to create the stack.

Your infrastructure should now successfully create!

### Activity 2: Prepare the EBS disk via the SLES Operating System

#### Step 1: Check the OS has detected the volume 

Start a terminal session to the RMT instance. 

Confirm the EBS volume appears to the OS by running the following command:

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    lsblk
:::

The output should appear similar to the below. It should be possible to see the 30GB disk in the 

output. 

:::code{showCopyAction=false showLineNumbers=true}
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~> lsblk
    NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    xvda 202:0 0 10G 0 disk
    â””â”€xvda1 202:1 0 10G 0 part /
    xvdf 202:80 0 30G 0 disk
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~>
:::

**ðŸ’¡ TIP**\ It is fine if your disk is not named exactly xvdf, just use the name it shows when running the commands in the next step.

#### Step 2: Partition the disk and create a filesystem 

Create a partition table with parted (replace xvdf with whatever your disk was named when you ran lsblk)

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    sudo parted /dev/xvdf mklabel gpt
:::

Create a Primary XFS partition

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    sudo parted -a optimal /dev/xvdf mkpart primary xfs 0% 100%
:::

The output should be as follows

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~> sudo parted -a optimal /dev/xvdf mkpart primary xfs 0% 100%
    Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.
:::

Create the XFS filesystem with the following command: 

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1 -L RMTDATA
:::

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~> sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdf1
    meta-data=/dev/xvdf1 isize=512 agcount=4, agsize=1965952 blks
    = sectsz=512 attr=2, projid32bit=1
    = crc=1 finobt=1, sparse=0, rmapbt=0
    = reflink=0
    data = bsize=4096 blocks=7863808, imaxpct=25
    = sunit=0 swidth=0 blks
    naming =version 2 bsize=4096 ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
    log =internal log bsize=4096 blocks=3839, version=2
    = sectsz=512 sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
    realtime =none extsz=4096 blocks=0, rtextents=0
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~>
:::


#### Step 3: Mount the New Disk

Create a mount point for the new disk

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    mkdir /var/lib/rmt
:::

Next, add the following to /etc/fstab to ensure the new filesystem is mounted at boot time

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    echo 'LABEL=RMTDATA /var/lib/rmt xfs defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
:::

Mount the new filesystem 

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    sudo mount -a
:::

Check the filesystem is mounted 

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    mount | grep xfs
:::

Note that /dev/xvdf1 is now mounted on /srv 

:::code{showCopyAction=true showLineNumbers=true}
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~> mount | grep xfs
    /dev/xvda1 on / type xfs (rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
    /dev/xvdf1 on /var/lib/rmt type xfs
    (rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
    ec2-user@ip-172-31-18-31:~>
